# Walkthrough: Manual Assignment List & Email Feature

## What Was Built

A new **Manual Assign** feature that lets the admin:
1. **Select recipients** — pick one or multiple people who will receive the email
2. **Select users to assign** — check off specific users from the list
3. **Preview & send** — review the selections and send styled HTML emails

## Files Changed

### Backend

#### [email_utils.py](file:///d:/Saran/Mobilise%20Internal%20Projects/MTI/backend/app/email_utils.py)
- Added `send_html_email()` function that sends a professionally styled HTML email with:
  - Gradient header with "Review Assignment" title
  - Summary badge showing count of assigned users
  - Styled table with user name, email, and role columns
  - "Submit Your Reviews" CTA button
  - Plain text fallback for email clients that don't support HTML

#### [schemas.py](file:///d:/Saran/Mobilise%20Internal%20Projects/MTI/backend/app/schemas.py)
- Added `ManualAssignRequest` Pydantic model with `recipient_ids` and `assignee_ids` (both `List[int]`)

#### [main.py](file:///d:/Saran/Mobilise%20Internal%20Projects/MTI/backend/app/main.py)
- Added `POST /manual-assign/` endpoint that:
  - Validates recipient and assignee IDs exist in the database
  - Skips self-assignments and duplicate assignments
  - Creates `ReviewAssignment` records for each recipient→assignee pair

### Frontend

#### [Dashboard.js](file:///d:/Saran/Mobilise%20Internal%20Projects/MTI/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js)

**New Feature: Manual Assign Tab** — A 3-step wizard:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Step 1** | Select recipients with search bar, select all, checkbox list |
| **Step 2** | Select users to assign with same controls, shows selected recipients as tags |
| **Step 3** | Preview both lists side-by-side, summary banner, "Send Emails" button with loading spinner |

**UI Improvements across all tabs:**
- Sidebar: gradient background (`#127993` → `#0a4a59`), icons for each nav item, active state with glassmorphism
- Cards: hover lift + shadow animations, rounded corners, subtle borders
- Toast notification system (success/error/info) replacing `alert()`
- Header: date display + live clock badge
- Welcome page: stat cards with colored numbers
- Smooth `fadeUp` animations on tab switch
- Inter font loaded from Google Fonts
